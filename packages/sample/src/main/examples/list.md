Nested list:

1.  Lists in a list item:

    - Indented four spaces.
      - indented eight spaces.
      - indented eight spaces.
    - Indented four spaces.
      - indented eight spaces.
    - Four spaces again.

    Lists in a list item:

    - Indented four spaces.
      - indented eight spaces.
      - indented eight spaces. (must have two new lines next)

2.  Single paragraphs in a list items:
    It's best to indent the paragraphs four spaces
    You can get away with three, but it can get
    confusing when you nest other things.
    Stick to four.

3.  Multiple paragraphs in a list items: It's best to indent the paragraphs four spaces
    You can get away with three, but it can get
    confusing when you nest other things.
    Stick to four.

    We indented the first line an extra space to align
    it with these paragraphs. In real use, we might do
    that to the entire list so that all items line up.

    This paragraph is still part of the list item, but it looks messy to humans. So it's a good idea to wrap your nested paragraphs manually, as we did with the first two.

4.  Blockquotes in a list item:

    > Skip a line and
    > indent the >'s four spaces.

5.  Preformatted text in a list item:

        Skip a line and indent eight spaces.
        That's four spaces for the list
        and four to trigger the code block.

6.  Single paragraphs in a list items:
    1. x
    2. y
    3. z
